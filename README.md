# Modelling &amp; Simulation (ModSim) Coursework

ModSim is a python based first-year Olin course in which I learned about how to abstract and model physical systems. For this course I completed 7 worksheets, 3 projects, and 2 mini-projects that are guided investigations into Orbital Mechanics and modelling the muliplication of HIV cells using the SEIR model.

My projects:

- [Lunch Time in the Olin dining hall](https://github.com/liloheinrich/ModSim/blob/main/Best%20Assignments/Project%201%20Lunch%20Time!%20Bahar%20and%20Lilo.pdf)
- How much can [global sea level rise](https://github.com/liloheinrich/ModSim/blob/main/Best%20Assignments/Project%202%20Sea%20Level%20Presentation.pdf) be mitigated by CO2 emission reduction?
- Creating a [glider flight simulation](https://github.com/liloheinrich/ModSim/blob/main/Best%20Assignments/Project%203%20Glider%20Flight%20Presentation.pdf) 

## Course goals:

- Create models of different kinds of systems (e.g., transportation systems, thermal systems, mechanical systems) 
- Use multiple kinds of appropriate abstractions (e.g., free-body &amp; stock-and-flow diagrams, differential equations) 
- Validate the predictions of models using different approaches (e.g., estimation, physical laws, analytical solutions)
- Use your models to do useful work (e.g., make predictions, explain behavior, evaluate design decisions)
- Use Python to implement models, run simulations, work with data, and generate visualizations
- Communicate technical and quantitative information effectively in several modes (e.g., written, spoken, graphical)
- Work effectively with a variety of teammates and in a variety of roles (e.g., “driver/navigator” in pair programming)
- Be a critical consumer (e.g., assess models encountered, evaluate whether appropriate/useful for given purpose)
- Understand the opportunities and responsibilities involved in creating and using models

## Modeling Mantras:
"All models are wrong, but some are useful."

"Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler."  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~ attributed to Albert Einstein

## Course Materials
The textbook for this course is [Modeling and Simulation in Python by Allen B. Downey](http://greenteapress.com/modsimpy/ModSimPy3.pdf).
